# PyBer_Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to determine how the data differed between the different types of cities: urban, suburban, and rural. Each type of city was analyzed in terms of how many rides were conducted, the total number of drivers, the total amount of fares collected, the average fare per ride, and the average fare per driver. A line graph was also created to visually show how the total fares in each type of city varied per week from January through May of 2019.

## Results

![This image shows the final statistics summary for the PyBer data broken up by type of city](https://github.com/hmpowell/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Pyber_summary_statistics_dataframe.png)

The above summary shows the following:
- There are more rides being taken in urban cities than suburban and rural combined.
- There are significantly more drivers in urban cities than suburban and rural areas.
- Only 6.4% of fares are from the rural cities; 62.7% are from urban areas; 30.5% of fares are from suburban cities.
- The average fare per ride in urban areas is $24.53. This average goes up as the size goes down with suburban areas having an average fare of $30.97 and rural areas having an average fare of $34.62.
- The average fair per driver in urban areas is $16.57. This average goes up as the size goes down with suburban areas having an average fare per driver of $39.50 and rural areas having an average fare per driver of $55.49.

These statistics make sense as the areas where there are less drivers, the cost to take a ride is higher and the areas where there are significantly more drivers, the cost to take a ride is lower. It also makes sense because of the assumed distance between destinations, since rural areas are more spread out. It would take a longer ride to get to another rural destination than in an urban area.

In the above graph, we can visually see the differences between the date in 2019 from January to May and the total fare amount broken up into the three types of cities. Though we stated before that rural drivers have a higher fare per trip, the large volume of rides being taken in urban areas keeps the total fare much higher in those areas. We can also see the urban areas have a higher volatility in terms of the total fare in different weeks, whereas the suburban and rural areas seem to be slightly more consistent in the total fares; however, all of the total fares see a sharp increase at the end of February, which then declines again by the beginning of March.


## Summary

### Business Recommendations

Based on the information in this analysis, I would make the following recommendations:

1. Increase prices when there are more customers utilizing PyBer, such as seen at the end of February in the 2019 data. Price surges would encourage more drivers to be on the road, allowing riders to get where they need to go faster and increasing total revenue. 
2. Advertise with riding incentives when there are less customers utilizing PyBer. This type of advertisement might encourage more ridership and increase overall revenue. One example of this time might be in urban areas in middle to late March when revenue is beginning to decrease. 
3. Begin targeted advertisements in the suburban and rural areas where there are not as many riders or drivers. Increasing the awareness of the service may help drive users to drive and ride. More studies may need to be conducted to determine the reasons in all areas why riders may not utilize PyBer's services. Once this information is analyzed, it would be easier to determine an advertising course of action.
